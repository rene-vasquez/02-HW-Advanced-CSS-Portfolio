# 02-HW-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

My website includes all the elements from the example picture. I made the entirety of this website during two long work sessions.

My first session consisted of creating a framework on paper and mapping out which elements I would need to arrange the site. I managed to style the header only, but it looked different than what it was supposed to be. I stopped my progress there for the day.

The Second session consisted of creating the main body of the website. At first i tried making three "rows" of information, but styling three different rows and having them match each other was too difficult. I switched my strategy to a massive flexbox with more flexboxes within them.

I continued to make the flexboxes and spent a long time styling everything.

Help Received:
I used Kanye Ipsum (http://www.kanye-ipsum.com/) for the generated text because I was feeling particularly inspired haha :)
I gathered photos from Pexels.com to use for the boxes
